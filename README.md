# ModuliCalculator
Using your phone's microphone as a pressure transducer, this app identifies the resonant frequencies of excited material samples and uses them to calculate key engineering parameters such as the Young's Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson Ratio.  Simply input the dimensions and mass of your sample, and the app will walk you through the rest!
